# Discrete-Structures
Coursework and projects for BYU CS 236 Discrete Structures.


## Course Outcomes: 

- Write Code From Diverse Program Components

- Demonstrate ability to build large programs by writing and integrating code from a diverse spectrum of program components.

- Use Mathematical Structures to Solve Programming Problems

- Understand and be conversant with basic discrete mathematical structures (finite state machines, regular expressions, grammars, propositional calculus, proof techniques, predicate calculus, sets, relations, functions, graphs).

- Write complex programs by using mathematical concepts as the basis for solving programming problems (finite state machines for lexical analysis; grammars for parsing; propositional and predicate calculus for logic programming; sets and algebras for relational databases; algebras, graphs, and topological sorting for optimizing datalog query processing).

- Incrementally build sophisticated programs by a systematic design process based on discrete mathematics.

- Design a solution for a programming problem and justify the design as one that is maintainable and extendable by other programmers who understand and are conversant with discrete mathematical structures.
